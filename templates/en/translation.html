{% block hi %}Hi!{% endblock %}
{% block intro %}My name is Alejandro, and I want to convince you that I'm the best Spanish translator for your project.{% endblock %}

<p>
    I am from Argentina and Spanish is my native tongue. I naturally also have a high degree of fluency in English, and I'm an avid reader in both languages. This reading includes Tolkien's and Borges' works on translation.
</p>
<p>
    I've taken that knowledge to endeavor in personal and profesional projects, like my current work as a Spanish to English translator for researchers at the Catholic University of Salta. I'm also proud to be the developer of various software related to linguistics, for example <a href="https://pypi.org/project/voseador/">Voseador</a>, a python library that improves Spanish conjugation tools and promotes the inclusion of the rioplatense variety of Spanish in linguistic projects. I've also developed a program that allows for the automatic creation of Constructed Languages based on Spanish —<a href="https://github.com/CoolRobotsAndStuff/simple-language-maker">Simple Language Maker</a>— which is particularly useful for fantasy writing.

    Show, don't Tell: a Sample of my Work
</h3>
<p>
    As they say, showing is better than telling, so I will now show you a sample of my work: the translation of a particularly tricky part in The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Caroll, a book widely regarded as extremely difficult to translate. Here I will compare my choices to the ones of other translators, and explain what I have to offer that others might not.
</p>
<p>The text in question is the following: </p>

<p class="quote">
    “You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice, “and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.

“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.

“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call it sad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:—

         “Fury said to a
         mouse, That he
        met in the
       house,
     ‘Let us
      both go to
       law: I will
        prosecute
         you.—Come,
           I’ll take no
           denial; We
          must have a
        trial: For
      really this
     morning I’ve
    nothing
    to do.’
      Said the
      mouse to the
       cur, ‘Such
        a trial,
         dear sir,
            With
          no jury
        or judge,
       would be
      wasting
      our
      breath.’
        ‘I’ll be
        judge, I’ll
         be jury,’
             Said
         cunning
          old Fury:
          ‘I’ll
          try the
            whole
            cause,
              and
           condemn
           you
          to
           death.’”

“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely. “What are you thinking of?”

“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got to the fifth bend, I think?”

“I had <i>not</i>!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”

“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”
</p>
<p>
    There are quite a few points of complexity here. Firstly, there are the tale-tail and not-knot puns, which are very dependent on the English language — <i>historia</i> and <i>cola</i> don't sound alike at all, and neither do <i>no</i> and <i>nudo</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Then there are hidden quirks. You may have noticed that the tale/tail is a poem, but what you probably haven't is that, if you format it into traditional stanza form, you end up with a kind of poem called... a <i>tail</i> poem! And why is it called that? Because each strophe is composed by two short verses and a third long one, forming a sort of tail (one could even say that each strophe looks like a little mouse). The short verses rhyme with each other, and the long verse rhymes with the one from the next strophe.

That he met in the house,
‘Let us both go to law: I will prosecute you.

—Come, I’ll take no denial;

For really this morning I’ve nothing to do.’

Said the mouse to the cur, 
‘Such a trial, dear sir,
With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.’
        
‘I’ll be judge, I’ll be jury,’
Said cunning old Fury:
‘I’ll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.’”
